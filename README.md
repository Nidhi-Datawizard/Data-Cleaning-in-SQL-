# Data-Cleaning-in-SQL

Here is a concise summary of a SQL data cleaning project:

Data cleaning is an essential step in any data analysis project, involving identifying and correcting inaccuracies or inconsistencies in a dataset.

Data cleaning in SQL involves identifying and fixing inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and irrelevant data in a dataset to ensure its quality for analysis and reporting.

It is considered an essential step in any data analysis project to prevent wasted time and inaccurate conclusions.

Common data cleaning tasks in SQL include deleting irrelevant or duplicate data, updating data values, and identifying inconsistencies.

Techniques used for data cleaning in SQL can include deleting data, updating data, and anomalies.

Deleting data is necessary for scenarios where the data is not pertinent, duplicated, or inaccurate.

SQL provides various functions and techniques for data cleaning, such as CASE WHEN, COALESCE, NULLIF, LEAST/GREATEST, and DISTINCT [3].

CASE WHEN is a function that allows mapping values in a column based on Boolean conditions. It can be used to create new columns based on specific criteria, such as categorizing employees as "New" or "Standard" based on their hire date.

COALESCE is used to replace NULL values with alternative values, providing cleaner and more consistent data for analysis.

NULLIF is used to replace specific values with NULL, allowing for easier identification and handling of inconsistent or irrelevant data.

LEAST and GREATEST functions are helpful for finding the minimum and maximum values among multiple columns, facilitating data cleaning tasks such as identifying outliers or data discrepancies.

DISTINCT is used to eliminate duplicate records from a dataset, ensuring data integrity and accuracy during analysis.

Real-world data cleaning projects in SQL may involve a combination of these techniques and functions, tailored to specific data quality issues and requirements. The examples provided in the sources mentioned can be used as a reference for implementing data cleaning tasks in SQL.
